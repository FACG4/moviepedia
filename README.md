### Why
To make people able to search on specific movie name and get some information about this movie such as the poster and some GIF images.

### What
It is a simple web page that allows users to hit the name of any movie and get some information about this movie. We have used two different API to get the final results. The first one is The Movie DB API, which does some search based on the input value that the user enter. The second API, which is Giphy, takes some results from the first API and does some serach to get GIFs related to the input that the user enter!

### How
We decided to work in two subgroups, each subgroup tries to understand the API and knows how this API works. Then we combine our work into one single final work.
